# UCI Heart Disease Analysis

This project demonstrates data analysis and machine learning on the UCI Heart Disease dataset. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and missing value imputation using advanced techniques.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values with machine learning-based imputation.
- **EDA:** Visualizes distributions and relationships (age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, thalassemia, and more).
- **Visualization:** Uses Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for interactive and publication-quality plots.
- **Reproducibility:** All steps are in a Jupyter notebook, with a `requirements.txt` for easy setup.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open `Heart_Diseas.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells.

## Dataset

- File: `heart_disease_uci.csv`

## Results
- Cleaned dataset saved as `heart_disease_cleaned.csv`.
- Insights into risk factors and data-driven visualizations.
